            Food and delicacies of any place are among the major factors most tourists consider before choosing to travel to any destination of their interest. Uganda the pearl of Africa is not only blessed with unique tourism attractions but also a number of delicacies prepared from locally grown and fresh from gardens food stuffs. While on a safari in Uganda, tourists should not make any mistake of leaving the country without tasting some of the popular foods in the country.

            Being a country with great cultural diversity, Uganda’s major food is attributed to various Ugandan cultures of the different tribes. Uganda has over 56 tribes and at least each tribe has a special culinary from which it’s recognized.

            Today, many tourists leave their usual places to different tourism destinations with the major aims of changing food and many of the tourists who have tasted Ugandan food always share their experiences and always cite specific foods like Luwombo, Nsenene and the “Ugandan Rolex”. Just as other well recognized culinary tourism destinations like France, Italy and Mexico, Uganda has equal and great potentials for attracting tourists with intentions of just tasting the local cuisines in the country.
            Recent research by the United Nations world tourism organization shows that culinary tourism is among the most trending tourism attractions of various destinations because now tourists visit places seeking for unique cultural experiences that are most times experienced in foods and traditional dance and drama. Because of that, most tourism destinations have shifted their focus on creating unique brands basing on the local cuisines available.

            An areas local food is one of the aspects you cannot separate from the natives of an area. Many Ugandan natives have different ways of preparing and serving food. All these can be best explained to an interested tourist in homestays or the many hotels and restaurants all over the country.

            Just as the saying goes that the easiest way to win a persons heart is through his stomach, Uganda has expert cooks and the leading restaurants and hotels that their works makes people’s mouth watery by a mere thinking about the food or after smelling the aroma from the food.

            Ugandan foods are very nutritious and those who taste say it’s very fresh and delicious. This has forced most hoteliers in Uganda to get ways and means of displaying and making the major foods of Uganda known to international tourists.
